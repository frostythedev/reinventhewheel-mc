# (Re)Invent The Wheel!
In all honesty, you probably shouldn't... you'll end up wasting time that could probably be better used doing something else. 

## About

(Re)Invent The Wheel is a small wiki/readme aimed at trying to discourage developers (mostly Minecraft here) from doing just as the title says, reinventing the wheel on resources that have already been made but instead conquer open sourced projects and **wield** them to your will!!!

Okay it's probably not that serious or diabolic but I hope you get the point.
